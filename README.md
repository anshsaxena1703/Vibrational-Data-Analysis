# Vibration Data Analysis from IoT Sensors
### Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of vibrational data collected from IoT sensors installed on industrial machines. The primary goal is to preprocess the data and perform graphical analyses.

# Project Steps
###  Data Collection
The vibrational data was collected using IoT sensors placed on various machines. The dataset includes time-series data reflecting the vibrational intensity and patterns over time.

### Data Preprocessing
The raw data required several preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and usability for further analysis:

Removal of Unnecessary Columns: Irrelevant or redundant columns were identified and removed from the dataset to streamline the analysis process.

Renaming Columns: The remaining columns were renamed for better clarity and understanding.

Graphical analyses were conducted to visualize the patterns and trends in the vibrational data: Visualized the vibrational intensity over time to identify trends and periodic patterns.Analyzed the relationships between different features in the dataset.
